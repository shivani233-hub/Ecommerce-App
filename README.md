## Features
- **Shipment Search Screen**: Allows users to search for shipments. If no input is provided, all shipment records are displayed.
- **Shipment Search Results Screen**: Displays the results of the search with pagination support using infinite scrolling.
- **Shipment Details Screen**: Provides detailed information about a selected shipment, including delivery method and expected dates.

## Tech Stack

## Modules

## Responsive Design
The application is styled for different devices:
- **Mobile**: max-width: 480px

## Localization
All static text is managed through JSON translation files using ngx-translate. For example:
```json
{
  "home": {
    "LABEL_WhatDoYouWantToDO": "What do you want to do?"
  }
}
```
